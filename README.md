Alguns pontos a serem considerados quando se gerando algo com IA:

1¬∫ - A IA, at√© o presente momento, √© uma ferramenta, ent√£o os resultados dependem fortemente da sua inten√ß√£o para com a ferramenta, o seu conhecimento da ferramenta (como, quando e onde ela pode ser utilizada) e do contexto / tema onde se pretende aplicar a IA.

2¬∫ - Conhecimento no tema √© essencial para evitar o GIGO (Garbage in, Garbage out = ‚ÄúLixo para dentro , lixo para fora‚Äù). √â muito importante ter o conhecimento no tema e de como elaborar um bom prompt para que voc√™ forne√ßa as entradas adequadas para IA, bem como modele a forma que ela deve tratar os dados de entrada. Isso permite uma sa√≠da / resultados melhores, mas que ainda carecem de revis√£o.

3¬∫ - A IA ainda tem suas limita√ß√µes, podendo alucinar, fornecer textos incompletos e/ou at√© mesmo equivocados. Portanto, a revis√£o dos dados gerados √© essencial.

4¬∫ - Estudo, estudo, estudo + pr√°tica, pr√°tica, pr√°tica... Sobre o contexto/tema que voc√™ atua, sobre as tecnologias, sobre engenharia de prompt s√£o essenciais para uma melhoria cont√≠nua dos resultados, bem como a velocidade de ger√°-los.

De forma geral, foi agrad√°vel realizar esse desafio. Para sair da zona de conforto.
